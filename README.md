FEED


Design is belonging to me. My idea was to mix instagram and twitter and add a little bit of myself.
Feed with "Post" model but two types of it. First one is with an image other one is with a plain text. I called them imagery and textry contents.
Post controller is fully functional you are able to like  and comment. Every label gets updated accordingly to handler that's triggered.

Diets and My Diet. 
"Diets" is not a completed feature. It is meant to be for sharing diets for free or not. Also giving users ability to rate and so letting content creators accerelate their way to the bigger audiance.
"My Diet" is a feature that gives away diets in a smart way. I work closely with nutrition professionals to improve this algorithm. It might not be best at this moment.
